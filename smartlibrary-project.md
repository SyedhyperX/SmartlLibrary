## 📞 Interview Questions & Answers

### Technical Questions

**Q: How did you handle authentication in this project?**
A: I implemented JWT-based authentication with role-based access control. The system uses bcrypt for password hashing, stores tokens in localStorage, and includes automatic token refresh. I also implemented protected routes and middleware for authorization.

**Q: How did you optimize database queries?**
A: I used MongoDB indexes on frequently queried fields like email, ISBN, and user references. I also implemented pagination for large datasets and used population selectively to avoid over-fetching data.

**Q: How would you scale this application?**
A: I'd implement horizontal scaling with load balancers, use Redis for caching, implement database sharding, and consider microservices architecture for different modules. I'd also add CDN for static assets and implement proper monitoring.

### System Design Questions

**Q: Walk me through the book issuing process.**
A: When an admin issues a book, the system: 1) Validates user and book availability, 2) Checks user limits and status, 3) Creates a transaction record, 4) Updates book availability count, 5) Adds transaction to user's issued books, 6) Sends notification/confirmation.

**Q: How do you handle concurrent book requests?**
A: I use database transactions to ensure atomic operations and implement proper error handling. The system checks availability at the time of transaction creation and uses optimistic locking to handle race conditions.
